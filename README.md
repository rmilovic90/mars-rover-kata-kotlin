# Mars Rover Kata

Develop an API that moves a rover around on a grid.

Rules:

1. You are given the initial starting point (0, 0, N) of a rover.
2. 0, 0 are X, Y coordinates on a grid of (10, 10).
3. N is the direction it is facing (i.e. N, S, E, W).
4. L and R allow the rover to rotate left and right.
5. M allows the rover to move one point in the current direction.
6. The rover receives a char array of commands e.g. RMMLM and
returns the finishing point after the moves e.g. 2:1:N.
7. The rover wraps around if it reaches the end of the grid.
8. The grid may have obstacles. If a given sequence of commands
encounters an obstacle, the rover moves up to the last possible
point and reports the obstacle e.g. 0:2:2:N.
